    <br>

    <h2>Exploring the novel innovations of NeRF Technology</h2>
    <p>The first workflow we are kicking things off with is our video/image -> 3D pipeline. With XSpada you're only a few clicks away from creating a virtual world that feels as if you are really there in the moment. Our platform accepts uploads from any capture device (mobile, DSLR, drone, 360 video, etc), offers a rapid turnaround time of 30 minutes, and is viewable within any browser & device. This experience can be shared in a multitude of ways depending on your subscription type.</p>

        <p><strong>Need a sneak peek?</strong> We uploaded a sample set of ~200 images and in no time at all, XSpada turned those images into a complete volumetric scene using the XSpada NeRF pipeline. Check out the NeRF we created with Franc Lucent (Michael Rubloff) at the Greystone Mansion in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p><em>(Use “WASD” to traverse within the scene, and arrow keys to change viewing angles. You can also click and drag to rotate the camera position.)</em></p>
